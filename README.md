# Gemini testing

## Getting Started

1️⃣ Fork + clone the project.  
2️⃣ Create a `.env` file and add a `NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY` variable. Set this variable to your Gemini API key. You can get your key from: https://aistudio.google.com/app/api-keys  
3️⃣ Run the project uisng `npm run dev`  
⚠️ DO NOT DEPLOY ANYTHING THAT USES THIS CODE!  
The codebase is made for laboration and testing, not safety. Some parts are even AI-assisted with sub-par validity checking.

## How to upload an image

Right click any image from a public source with CORS allowed and press `copy image link`. Paste the link in the browser bar and it'll automatically show up.  
Note: If the image source page does not allow CORS you will need to source the image from another site.
